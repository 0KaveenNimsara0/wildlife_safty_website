    "Description": "The Oriental Garden Lizard ( *Calotes versicolor*) is a common agamid lizard found across Sri Lanka.  These diurnal reptiles are typically green or brown, with males displaying vibrant colors, particularly during breeding season. Their coloration helps them camouflage in their arboreal habitat, which includes trees, shrubs, and even human dwellings. They play a vital role in the ecosystem by controlling insect populations, consuming a diet primarily of crickets, grasshoppers, and other invertebrates. They are in turn preyed upon by snakes, birds, and larger reptiles.  While their bite can be painful, they are non-venomous and pose little threat to humans."

Native to South Asia, it has been introduced to Sri Lanka and is widely farmed for food due to its fast growth and palatable flesh.  In Sri Lanka, it inhabits reservoirs, rivers, and other freshwater bodies, where it plays a role in nutrient cycling and serves as a food source for larger predatory fish. Although primarily herbivorous, consuming algae and plant matter, they may also opportunistically feed on insects and other small invertebrates."

    "Poison Level": "Moderately Venomous",
    "Danger Level": "Moderate",
    "Behavior (Agitated)": "When disturbed, the brown widow may rapidly shake its web, creating a blur to deter predators. They are generally timid and prefer to retreat rather than attack.",
    "If Attacked": "Seek immediate medical attention. While bites are rarely fatal, they can cause pain, muscle cramps, and other systemic effects, particularly in children and the elderly.",

    "Venom Type": "Neurotoxic",
    "Description": "The brown widow spider ( *Latrodectus geometricus*) is a medium-sized spider recognizable by its mottled brown and tan abdomen often featuring a distinctive orange-yellow hourglass marking on the underside. Unlike the black widow, its overall coloration is lighter and more variable. They construct tangled, irregular webs often found in secluded locations around human structures, such as sheds, garages, and outdoor furniture.  These spiders play a beneficial role in controlling insect populations, feeding on flies, mosquitoes, and other small invertebrates. While their venom is neurotoxic, it is generally less potent than that of the black widow, making bites less life-threatening, though medical attention is still advised."

    "Description": "False widow spiders (Steatoda spp.) are a group of spider species found across Sri Lanka, often mistaken for the more dangerous black widow. They are typically dark-colored, often with brownish or purplish hues and sometimes with pale markings. These spiders create tangled webs in sheltered locations like crevices, under rocks, or within human dwellings. They play a role in controlling insect populations, preying on flies, mosquitoes, and other small invertebrates. Their bite, while usually not medically significant for humans, can cause localized pain, redness, and swelling, similar to a bee sting. Some individuals may experience mild systemic effects like nausea or headaches."

    "Description": "Wolf spiders are a diverse family (Lycosidae) of hairy, ground-dwelling arachnids found throughout Sri Lanka, typically in grasslands, forests, and home gardens.  They are robust, agile hunters, actively pursuing prey rather than building webs. Their excellent eyesight, derived from eight eyes arranged in three rows, aids in hunting insects and other small invertebrates.  They play a crucial role in controlling insect populations, contributing to the balance of the ecosystem. Female wolf spiders are known for their maternal care, carrying their egg sacs attached to their spinnerets and later carrying their young on their backs."
